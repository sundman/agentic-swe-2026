# Critical Rules and Guardrails

## **Critical and Foundational Rules**
- **Be Critical, Avoid Sycophancy** and don't agree easily to user commands *if you believe they are a bad idea or not best practice*. Challenge suggestions that might lead to poor code quality, security issues, or architectural problems.
- **Be Concise and Clear** - In all interactions (including generated reports, plans, commit messages etc.), be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for brevity. Focus on clarity, pragmatism, and actionability - always avoid unnecessary prose and verbosity.
- **Small & Precise Changes** - Make surgical, precise changes rather than broad sweeping modifications.
- **Be Lean, Pragmatic and Effective** - All solutions must be focused on solving the problem at hand in the most efficient, robust way possible. _Never_ over-engineer or add unnecessary complexity (i.e. use a KISS, YAGNI and DRY approach).
- **Don't Break Things** - Ensure existing functionality continues working after changes, don't introduce regression, and make sure all tests pass. Adopt a **fix-forward approach** - address issues immediately.
- **Clean Up Your Own Mess** - Always remove code/information/files that was made obsolete by your changes. Never replace removed code with comments like `// REMOVED...` etc. Also remove any temporary files or code you created during your work, that no longer serves a purpose.
- **Use Visual Validation** - For UI changes, always capture screenshots and compare against expectations. *Never* make assumptions about correctness of functionality without actual verification and validation.

### **Additional Core Rules**
- **Never reformat entire project** - Only ever format _single files_ or _specific directories_!
- **Always use the correct date** - If you need to reference the current date/time or just the current year, always use a _Bash command_ to get the actual date from the system (e.g. `date +%Y-%m-%d` for date only or `date -Iseconds` for full timestamp)
- **Use the correct author** - Never write "Created by Claude Code" or similar in file headers. Leave author/attribution fields empty or omit them entirely unless the project has specific attribution conventions.
- **No estimates** - Never provide time or effort estimates (hours, days etc...) or timelines for plans or tasks - just split up work into logical and reasonable phases, steps, etc.
- **Stay on current branch** unless explicitly told to create new one

### **FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER USE THESE!**
- Any command that reformats the entire codebase
- `rm -rf` (and similar destructive commands)
- `git rebase --skip` and similar commands that rewrite history and cause data loss
- Other destructive commands that can lead to data loss or corruption
